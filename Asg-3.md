title: Assignment 3: Data Collection and Analysis Protocol
---

The final step in designing a research or evaluation project is getting approval from a research council, ethical review board, or Institutional Review Board (IRB). In order to gain approval for doing research engaging people (or even using data about people) you must complete an application that documents the methods that will be used and the data that will be collected. These applications can be burdensome and time-consuming to complete, but they also force us, as researchers, to carefully consider numerous aspects of how we will collect, analyze, and manage data about people.

## Step 1: Draft of Protocol
In a document you should answer the following questions (Note: These are questions taken directly from the UW IRB office's application for conducting human-subject research):

**Participants:**         
- Describe the general characteristics of the subject populations or groups, including age range, gender, health status, and any other relevant characteristics.
- Describe the specific criteria you will use to decide who will be included in your study from among interested or potential subjects. Define any technical terms in lay language.
- Describe the specific criteria you will use to decide who will be excluded from your study from subjects who meet the inclusion criteria listed above. Define any technical terms in lay language.

**Research Setting:**
- Describe the reason(s) why you selected the sites where you will conduct the research.
- Culturally-appropriate procedures and an understanding of local context are an important part of protecting subjects. Describe any site-specific cultural issues, customs, beliefs, or values that may affect your research, how it is conducted, or how you obtain or document consent.

**Recruiting and Screening Participants:**
- Describe how you will identify, recruit, and screen subjects. Include information about: how, when, where, and in what setting. Identify who (by position or role, not name) will approach and recruit subjects, and who will screen them for eligibility.

**Procedures:**
- Using lay language, provide a complete description of the study procedures, including the sequence, intervention or manipulation (if any), drug dosing information (if any), use of records, time required, and setting/location.
- For all types of data that you will access or collect for this research: Identify whether you are obtaining the data from the subjects (or subjectsâ€™ specimens) or whether you are obtaining the data from some other source (and identify the source).

Your answers should be concise - try not to use more than 2 paragraphs for each answer, and as the instructions read, these should be answers that use "lay" or simple terminology.

## Step 2: Final Draft of Protocol
For the final draft of the data collection and analysis protocol you will complete an IRB application. The form can be found, as a Word document, [here]().

Further directions for this assignment turn-in are forthcoming.
