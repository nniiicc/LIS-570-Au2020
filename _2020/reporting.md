**Week 10 - Research Reporting**: In the final substantive week of the class we will discuss the elements of a research paper - how to publish and where to publish; how to navigate peer review; and the emergent practices of open science in LIS and beyond.


## Readings
Below are a number of examples that could all fit into our LIS spotlight series. But, I think each of these are examples of how to report on professional activities in peer reviewed publications using productive and helpful narrative styles. Choose just one to read for your readings this week (you likely have a few other things going on right now :) )
