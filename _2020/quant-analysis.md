**Week 7 + 8 - Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis**: Quantitative methods are used less in LIS but play an important role in the design of program evaluation and assessment In Weeks 7 and 8 we will briefly discuss how to collect and obtain quantitative data, and how to use descriptive and inferential statistics to pursue a hypothesis.

## Readings
You have two choices this week for readings - the first is primarily an overview of descriptive statistics, and the second is further reading in a book about quantitative methods.

- Doucette, L. (2017). Quantitative Methods and Inferential Statistics: Capacity and Development for Librarians. Evidence Based Library and Information Practice, 12(2), 53-58. [PDF](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/28873/21388)

- Blaikie, N. (2003). Analyzing quantitative data: From description to explanation. Sage. [PDF](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/readings/Week6/Blaikie.pdf) Continue to read Ch 1 from pages 28-36 - this covers analysis and logic of quantiative data, and also nicely summarizes the main points of the entire first chapter.

**LIS Research Spotlight**
- Harper, C. (2018). Machine Learning and the Library or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Robot Overlords. Code4Lib Journal, (41), 6. [HTML](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/13671)

**Suggested**

- Zhang, J., Wang, Y., & Zhao, Y. (2017). Investigation on the statistical methods in research studies of library and information science. The Electronic Library. [HTML](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EL-02-2016-0042/full/html) (This gives a great overview of how often and what kinds of statistics are used in LIS research)
