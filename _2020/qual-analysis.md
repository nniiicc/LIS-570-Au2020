**Week 5 + 6 - Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis**: One of the major paradigms in LIS research is the collection and analysis of data using qualitative methods. In this two week class session we will discuss data collection methods like interviews, surveys, and content analysis. We will also discuss analytic techniques such as interview coding, memo writing, and ethnographic reporting.

## Exercise

The exercise this week focuses on qualitatively coding data. [This file](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/Exercises/qual_data_analy.pdf) contains a free response question found on a survey of 500 K-12 educators. The survey was distributed on 12.2010 in Bloomington IN at an educational conference.
The participants, who are all teachers, are responding to the question “What major factors led you into teaching?”

Here are your instructions:
- Begin by thematically coding responses from each participant
- After the first 30 responses, try to develop just 5 codes that categorize “factors” that led a person to pursue teaching. You made to revise these codes by lumping or splitting the codes.
- Apply the 5 codes to 50 more responses.  
- Continue to do this until your five codes seem stable - then give them a definition.
- You may want to follow the conventions that we described in class for a codebook (a definition, an application, and an example)

Bring your codes to class next week for discussion.
