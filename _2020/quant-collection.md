**Week 7 + 8 - Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis**: Quantitative methods are used less in LIS but play an important role in the design of program evaluation and assessment In Weeks 7 and 8 we will briefly discuss how to collect and obtain quantitative data, and how to use descriptive and inferential statistics to pursue a hypothesis.

## Readings

Hobbes, M. & Marshall, S. (2020, Jul. 27). Murder. You're wrong about [audio podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1112270/4721657-murder?play=true) Note: The episode begins with the question relating to the frequency of homicides being solved over time, and continues on to engage with relationships between the findings from numerous different quantitative datasets relating to homicide. the discussion does not involve any graphic details about homicides themselves; the hosts are mostly engaged with how data is collected and interpreted in strategic ways to answer questions about homicides, and the broader social implications of conclusions made from these datasets. towards the end of the episode, there is a somewhat graphic description of an example of police brutality.
