**Week 7 + 8 - Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis**: Quantitative methods are used less in LIS but play an important role in the design of program evaluation and assessment In Weeks 7 and 8 we will briefly discuss how to collect and obtain quantitative data, and how to use descriptive and inferential statistics to pursue a hypothesis.

Slides for the lecture are [here](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/slides/LIS-570-QuantDataCollection.pdf)

There are two referenced readings in the lecture:
- The E-book Power User in Academic and Research Libraries: Deep Log Analysis and User Customization https://doi.org/10.1080/00048623.2014.885374
- Public library computer training for older adults to access high-quality Internet health information https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2009.03.004  

## Readings

There are three choices of readings for this week - an explanation follows each of the three choices:

- Goertzen, M. J. (2017). Introduction to quantitative research and data. Library Technology Reports, 53(4), 12-18. [PDF](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/readings/Week6/IntroToQuantLIS.pdf) - this is a general reader on how to do quantitative research in an LIS setting. If you are looking to understand some basic concepts, but not dive deep into quantitative research methods this is the most appropriate reading for you.

- A Meadows, K. (2003). So you want to do research? 4: An introduction to quantitative methods. British Journal of Community Nursing, 8(11), 519-526. [PDF](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/readings/Week6/SoYouWantTo.pdf) - This is an introduction to thinking with quantitative methods, and focuses on examples in survey research.

- Blaikie, N. (2003). Analyzing quantitative data: From description to explanation. Sage. [PDF](https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/readings/Week6/Blaikie.pdf) This is one of the most thorough and approachable introductions to question asking, data management, collection and analysis using quantitative methods. I have provided the entire book, but for this week you should read Ch 1 from pages 10-27 (stop at the section that begins 'Transformations between Levels of Measurement')

**LIS Research Spotlight**

Jæger, M. M., & Blaabæk, E. H. (2020). Inequality in learning opportunities during Covid-19: Evidence from library takeout. Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, 68, 100524. [HTML](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562420300603)

**Suggested**

Hobbes, M. & Marshall, S. (2020, Jul. 27). Murder. You're wrong about [audio podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1112270/4721657-murder?play=true) Note: The episode begins with the question relating to the frequency of homicides being solved over time, and continues on to engage with relationships between the findings from numerous different quantitative datasets relating to homicide. the discussion does not involve any graphic details about homicides themselves; the hosts are mostly engaged with how data is collected and interpreted in strategic ways to answer questions about homicides, and the broader social implications of conclusions made from these datasets. towards the end of the episode, there is a somewhat graphic description of an example of police brutality.
