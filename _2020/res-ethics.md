**Week 3 - Research Ethics**: Conducting research with human subjects creates an imbalance of power. In many ways, ethics help us manage and make sense of the appropriate, fair, and just use of that power to gain new knowledge. In this week we will investigate forms of normative ethics as well as their practical implementation in institutional review boards.


## Readings
The required reading this week is from a short introductory textbook on philosophy. If you aren't particularly interested in the subject of ethics - you will be better served by reading the `Summary` section of this article and then diving into one of the suggested readings instead. But, to be clear on why we are reading this - Virtue, Consequential and Deontological ethics are probably the most common ways that a researcher will argued for "ethical" choices. Being able to clearly and easily pick these out will help immensely in your future work.
