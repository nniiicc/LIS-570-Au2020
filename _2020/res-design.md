**Week 4 - Research Design**: The ability to meaningfully select research topics, pose research questions, sample populations, and securely manage data are part of the research design process. Throughout Week 4 we will work through the different elements of a research project's design.

## Readings
Read the introduction, and then choose two types of research designs to read about (for clarity - each type is a method): USC LibGuide on Designing Research Projects - [HTML](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/researchdesigns)

The design of a research project doesn't need to be fully about creating brand new knowledge - it may also be for the purposes of conducting an evaluation of an ongoing program. Read a short introduction to Evaluation and its different design considerations [at this link (HTML)](https://conjointly.com/kb/introduction-to-evaluation/)
