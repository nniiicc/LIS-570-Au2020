**Week 9 - Design-based Methods**: An emergent field of research and evaluation makes use of design-based methods in LIS. These methods are often highly interactive and require a close association with research participants. In this week we will discuss methods such as 'value sensitive design' and 'diverse voices' to understand how to best apply design methods to LIS settings.
