<h1 id="what-should-we-call-you">What should we call you?</h1>

<p>Please call me Dr. Weber, Professor Weber, or Nic. My pronouns are he / him.</p>

<p>Please call your TA’s Claire (they/them) and Wan-Chen (she/her).</p>

<h1 id="if-you-are-the-assistant-professor-who-is-the-actual-professor-of-this-class">If you are the assistant professor, who is the actual professor of this class?</h1>

<p>Good question! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_the_United_States">Academic titles</a> are confusing and weird. Assistant professor simply means that I don’t have tenure (yet). You’d be surprised how many students are waiting until the 10th week to find out who their <strong>actual</strong> professor is …</p>

<h1 id="if-we-have-a-question-who-should-we-contact-and-how">If we have a question, who should we contact (and how)?</h1>
<p>Use the following guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Canvas forum</a>: Any question about content or assignments that might be helpful for the entire class to see a response</li>
  <li>Email to TA: Any communication that requires specific personal consideration</li>
  <li>Email to Nic:  Same as above - but you’d like me SPECIFICALLY to provide feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>Please give us 24 hours to respond to any email or forum post. If you don’t get a response then please feel free to send a follow up (I promise - we’re not ignoring you! Your email might have just fallen through the cracks)</p>

<h1 id="why-dont-we-just-use-canvas">Why don’t we just use Canvas?</h1>
<p>During a traditional course at the UW iSchool you will interact with almost all of the content produced by your instructor via platforms like Canvas and VoiceThread.</p>

<p>Over the last 5 years of teaching, I’ve been increasingly frustrated by the way that these platforms enable (or constrain) learning at a public university. There are a number of things that Canvas does well, but one of them is NOT creating sustainable and dynamic learning materials. Also - Canvas has plans to analyze and eventually profit off of your data. Call me a liberal nut-job, but I don’t think obtaining a public education should expose you to surveillance capitalism.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-this-site">What is this site?</h1>
<p>Instead of preparing content to live in Canvas, I use a course site that contains chapters, lectures (videos), readings, and exercises. The site is hosted in a software repository that allows me to customize and make all the changes necessary to keep the site up and running.</p>

<p>What this means for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This site and all of the content (videos, readings, etc) will remain accessible - whether you are enrolled at the University of Washington or not.</li>
  <li>Is optimized for reading and viewing across different operating systems and devices - meaning you can watch videos on your phone while you cook dinner, or read chapters on your tablet on your couch.</li>
  <li>Allows me and your TA’s to more easily edit, update, and automate parts of the site publication process. We reinvest our time in developing better course content for you.</li>
</ul>
