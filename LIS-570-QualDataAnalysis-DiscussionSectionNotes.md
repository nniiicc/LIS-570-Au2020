1. Reviews are back...
2. November 20 is new due date for Data Collection

Keep in mind - final drafts are all due December 4th
-


## For today:
- Describe the method you might use, and the type of data that you are collecting.
- What will be necessary to transform that data from collection to analysis?
- Where would you store that data - and how would you prevent it from exposing personal identities?

## Qualitative analysis
- We discussed last week the idea that inductively - we are going to treat qualitative data as if it contains particular examples that we want to generalize from ...

- And in this process - we don't make a great leap, but instead take almost circular steps - first describing, then organizing, then revising, etc.

- This process of making sense of our data most oftenr results in a set of progressively sophisticated CODES

- Now - who did the activity https://github.com/nniiicc/LIS-570-Au2020/raw/master/Exercises/qual_data_analy.pdf

The exercise this week focuses on qualitatively coding data. This file contains a free response question found on a survey of 500 K-12 educators. The survey was distributed on 12.2010 in Bloomington IN at an educational conference. The participants, who are all teachers, are responding to the question “What major factors led you into teaching?”

Here are your instructions:

    Begin by thematically coding responses from each participant
    After the first 30 responses, try to develop just 5 codes that categorize “factors” that led a person to pursue teaching. You made to revise these codes by lumping or splitting the codes.
    Apply the 5 codes to 50 more responses.
    Continue to do this until your five codes seem stable - then give them a definition.
    You may want to follow the conventions that we described in class for a codebook (a definition, an application, and an example)

Bring your codes to class next week for discussion.


## Coding your own data ...

We aren't blind to the themes we expect to find in our data collection
- Take a minute to think of three themes
- Write these down and create a definition for them
- Now share these and tell us how this helps you answer your RQ
